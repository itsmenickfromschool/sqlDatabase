  ## [Video of app]()
  ## Description
  This project was about making a content management system for a business. I used Inquirer as well as mysql2 for the project. The App in entirely run in the backend. There is no forward-facing User-Interface. The App can be used to create and view roles, departments, and employees within a SQL database. Additionally, you can update an employee's role. Throughout building this app I learned how to interface with a SQL database through Javascript. I also learned a lot about SQL in general, speicifically Querying as well as seeding the data in the right order so the relationships between the foreign and primary keys was succesful. Moving forward, I would refactor my code to use async/await instead of relying on callback functions, additionally I would add more features such as the ability to delete employees, roles, and departments.
